Scenario Based Task 2:

Your company received a request to translate a multilingual spreadsheet with medical device information. At first glance, the spreadsheet seemed to be easy to handle: most strings appeared to be repeating themselves, differing only in number digits that represent measurements. 

Except, there seemed to be one problem: as your project manager imported this document into the CAT tool for analysis, she noticed that despite such similarities, the CAT tool did not treat them as repetitions or close fuzzy matches - primarily because these strings were too short. This means that in translation, linguists would need to copy and paste the same string a dozen of times and change the measurements manually (also imagine a scenario where there are over a hundred such strings). Also, your project manager would have to charge the client as if all strings were NEW WORDS. Apparently, your client would not be happy about your pricing strategy: after all, most of the strings were quite similar and it wouldn’t be fair for them to pay for the translation of “Medical Equipment One Type” 10 times (if not more). 

Your project manager then asked for your help. Is there a way to reduce the cost of translation?

Try to design a solution that resolves your project manager’s concern. Attach your prepared/modified source document (if any) and explain your solution.
