File Handling Task: Organize folder structure & handle filenames in batch

Here is the thing. The project manager has been working with a translation vendor agency on a project into 8 languages. Your project manager made it clear that the end delivery format is .docx and should follow a specific folder structure: all documents should retain their original name, but also be placed in a folder named by the language-country code. For example, a file named "fileName.docx" in English should retain its original name, but be placed in a folder named "en-US".

Unfortunately, the translation agency your PM is working with failed to follow these instructions. Instead of putting files in language folders, they attached the language country code at the end of each translated file. For example, fileName.docx is now fileName-en-US.docx. and they sent all files back within a SINGLE folder

As annoyed as your project manager could get, she needed your help on this because she just learnt that this whole translation agency went out of office for the Chinese lunar year, which means it is impossible for her to send the files back to them. With the deadline approaching in 5 to 6 hours, and given that there are 20+ files into 8 languages (which put the total file count at 160+), manually renaming files and organizing them into different folders has become an impossible task.

Task Description: 

Design a solution that reverts the file names back into its original format, and organize the files in the desired folder structure. 

If your solution is a script or a program, feel free to attach it.
