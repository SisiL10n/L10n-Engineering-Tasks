This repository is a collection of localization engineering tasks inspired by real world l10n scenarios.  
File Handling Tasks:
1. Print file path
2. Organize folder structure & handle filenames in batch
3. TMS report conversion

Scenario-based Tasks:
1. Filter monolingual XML
2. Handle excel with placeholders
3. Multilingual XML parsing

They are developed by my amazing mentor Shelton Shen.  

I implemented solutions to these problems using Python.
