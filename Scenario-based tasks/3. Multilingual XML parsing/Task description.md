Scenario Based Task 2:

Sample 5.xml

So in addition to the multilingual spreadsheets, the client also sent you an XML (link above) which appears to be multilingual as well. Here are the detailed requirements:

1)	For all segments, add a “French Canada” as <FRC>. (in the task you can use either pseudo translation or machine translation)
2)	For segments already with translation, the client wanted them reviewed/proofread. Translate the other fields.

Choose whichever tools at your disposal. Also imagine this file runs up to 5000 lines, which makes it impossible to do copy-and-paste to a spreadsheet.
