File Handling Task: Generate file path

For one thing, currently there is a project with 200+ files saved in a nested folder structure. The project manager would like to know if there is a way to generate a file list that she can show to the client. 

Task Description:
Generate a file list that contains all files in a folder. If there is a nested folder, you may skip the name of the folder but all files in that folder should be included in your file list.

Tips:
1)	Your solution should allow the end user (i.e., the project manager) to specify a root folder path
2)	Feel free to attach the script/programme.
